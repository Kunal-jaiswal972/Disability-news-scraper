The sub-registrar's office where the incident occurred is in a building belonging to MTNL, which is under dissolution and lacks a working lift. The incident raised discussions on the impact of the term 'divyang' on the lives of disabled citizens."

Factors contributing to this include their use of assistive technologies, lack of awareness about cyber threats, and targeted phishing attacks. Scammers often pose as representatives and exploit PWDs' vulnerabilities. To stay safe, PWDs should verify the recipient before sharing confidential information and be aware of different types of threats. They should avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading applications from unknown sources. If victimized, PWDs should report the cyber attack. Organizations serving PWDs should also implement strong security measures, educate employees, and provide information to clients about cyber security."
